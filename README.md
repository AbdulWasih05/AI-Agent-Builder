# Ai Agent Builder

### Personal AI Academics Assignment

### Uploading on git just for version control

A small demo project to build, run and experiment with agentic AI. Designed for personal academic assignment and version control.

## Simple Chatbot

A very small command-line chatbot example is included in `chatbot.py`.

Run it with Python (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
python chatbot.py
```

Controls:
- Type any message and the bot will respond by simple keyword matching.
- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `bye` (or press Ctrl+C) to end the session.

The script is dependency-free and works with Python 3.6+.
